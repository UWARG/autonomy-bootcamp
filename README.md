# Justin's bootcamp submission notes
The repo is organized into three folders:
1. The `data` directory contains the raw data batches, which is imported by the files in the `model` directory.
2. The `model` directory contains two files: `model.ipynb`, a Jupyter notebook which contains my extended descriptions, output logs, plots, and runnable code at each step of the workflow. `model.py` contains the Python script by itself which can be run, and has less of my comments.
3. The `plots` directory contains plots of the model performance (and intended for other data visualizations but there was no need for that here)
