"""
Grades the tests the bootcamper wrote in ``tests/test_waypoint_utils.py``.

Gate 1 is that the tests pass on the real module with >= 90% branch
coverage. Gate 2 reruns them against each broken copy in
``grader/mutants/``, every one of which has to FAIL. Coverage alone proves
the code ran; the mutants prove the tests actually checked something.

Run from ``utils/``. Standard library only.
