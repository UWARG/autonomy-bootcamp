"""SimCamera: YOUR Part 2 assignment.

A camera that makes up its own frames. Read ``src/fixed.py`` and its tests
first, then make ``tests/test_sim_camera.py`` pass:

    warg run camera test

``SimCamera(width=64, height=48)`` hands back a ``(height, width, 3)``
``uint8`` frame every time you ask, for as long as it's on, with ``index``
counting up from 0. Same rules as every camera
(``src/abstract_camera.py``), plus one:

A frame's pixels depend only on its index. Frame 2 always looks the same,
here or in any SimCamera built with the same size, and frames with different
indexes look different. Fill values, gradients, and
``numpy.random.default_rng(index)`` all work.
