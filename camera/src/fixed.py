"""FixedCamera: a finished camera example

Hand it a list of images and it gives them back one at a time. It exists to
make tests repeatable, and as your reference for Part 2. Read it with
``tests/test_fixed_camera.py``.

Worth stealing: the ``_initialized`` flag, ``_next_timestamp()``, and the
two ``.copy()`` calls.

class FixedCamera(AbstractCamera):
    """A camera that plays back a list of images you give it.

    Loops the list forever, so it behaves like any other camera: capture as
    long as it's on. ``index`` counts captures, not position in the list.

    Args:
        frames: A list, with at least one item, of ``(height, width, 3)``
            ``uint8`` numpy arrays. The camera keeps its own copies, so
            changing your arrays afterwards does nothing to it.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If ``frames`` isn't a list, or something in it isn't a
            numpy array.
        ValueError: If ``frames`` is empty, or an array isn't shaped
            ``(height, width, 3)`` with dtype ``uint8``.

    Example:
        >>> images = [np.zeros((4, 6, 3), dtype=np.uint8)]
        >>> camera = FixedCamera(images)
        >>> camera.initialize_camera()
